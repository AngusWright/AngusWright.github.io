## Welcome 

This website primarily functions as the host place for my "Introduction to Statistics for Astronomers and Physicists"
Lecture Notes. For those interested, it also contains links to my academic curriculum vitae and relevant websites. 

### About me 

I am a Research Fellow in the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing (GCCL) at the Ruhr Universität Bochum (RUB),
Germany. I undertook my PhD at the University of Western Australia, where I studied the growth and evolution of
baryonic mass as a member of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) collaboration. Following my PhD, I worked for the
Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) at the Argelander Institute for Astronomy at the Universität Bonn, where I began my work
within weak gravitational lensing. For the last 5 years my research has focused on weak lensing survey science, and
particularly on optimisation of photometric image reduction and analysis methods, systematics mitigation, and
statistical analyses. Beyond weak lensing, I am a keen astrostatistician, an animated astronomy outreach presenter,
and an enthusiastic but nonetheless mediocre golfer.

### Introduction to Statistics for Astronomers and Physicists 

At the RUB I teach an introductory course in statistics for students studying Physics and Astronomy. The course is
designed to be accessible to students with little or no previous statistical training. I attempt to develop a new aspect
of the course each semester, and welcome comments/feedback about the course and it's contents. Any comments can be added
to my [AstroStats github repository](https://github.com/AngusWright/AstroStats) using the 
[issues list](https://github.com/AngusWright/AstroStats/issues). 

The lecture notes are directly accessible here in two formats: 

1. The *HTML-page* format presents the lectures each on a single HTML page, with a persistent table of contents and
   dynamic media. LaTeX, images, and code are all rendered in-place. For those who prefer, the page can be switched
   between *light* and **dark** mode using the toggle button beneath the table of contents. 
2. The *HTML-slides* format presents the lectures on a series of HTML slides. The slides are somewhat unconventional, in
   that they are variable in length (i.e. not like powerpoint). However I have found this to be the best format for 
   conveying the information here. 

Additional formats (PDF, markdown, and rmarkdown) are available in the [git
repository](https://github.com/AngusWright/AstroStats/). These formats have limitations, however, as they variously
cannot display animations (PDF) or latex (markdown) in a generally satisfactory way. The lectures themselves are written 
in rmarkdown, and can be compiled into the other formats within R/Rstudio.

#### Cloning the lecture notes 

The lecture notes can be directly downloaded in many formats from the [github repository](), or from the command line as
below: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AngusWright/AstroStats.git
```
